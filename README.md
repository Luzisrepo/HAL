## What is HAL??
> HAL is just a fan-made scene from the game "The Operator", where you talk to HAL, a hacker who has breached ur computer.

## How do I use HAL?
> To use HAL you can either use the online version (Full with audio and effect integration) or use the offline version, a batch script (no sound or fancy effects).

## Why batch script when it doesn't support sound implementation, and lets be real, it sucks?
> I used batch script for this project because I'm not home and this dog ass laptop's python instalation is fked and I can't install libraries. (I cba to fix it, I'll just wait until I get home.)

## Will there be updates to the offline version?
> Yes, I will incorporate sound and effects on the python version of the script. It is yet barebones (since I can't even test it) and located on the "fupdate" folder.

## Privacy concerns.
> Yes there is a general info grabber that will later be used for HAL. Don't open the offline version if you don't have a VPN.

## Why is this info needed?
> I'm planning on making a more in-depth version on the offline mode of this, where hal actually creates and manages files on your computer, aswell as an expansoion of the story.

## TO NOTE
> Offline mode DOES need wifi for the IP grabber part, but you can use it without it just fine. (but the script might break)

# TO-DO LIST
- Rewrite offline mode with python.
- Add audio and effects to offline mode.
